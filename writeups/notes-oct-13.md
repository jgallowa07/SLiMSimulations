Notes after lab meeting on 10/12/17:

- Bill: liked the migration vs no migration comparison since it tells us
    how important the metapopluation structure is.

- dominance: split each +/- class into under/overdominant classes
    with dominance coefficient 0.0 and 1.0),
    and compare usage of the two 
    (hypothesis: the underdominant freshwater alleles will be used more)

Final products:

- higher-level plot with parameter on the x-axis and summary on the y-axis, e.g.:

    * x-axis:

        - migration rate
        - number of individuals, by increasing number of lakes but keeping number per lake the same 
            (always, distance between lakes is the same)
        - spatial structure, by keeping total number the same but increasing number of lakes 
        - size of "new lake" budded off

    * y-axis:

        - SD of trait value in ocean and lake


- isolation by distance: Fst against distance in ocean, lake

- what are frequencies of the functional SNPs used in the newly adapted population
    in the ocean?

    * make frequency trajectory plots of functional SNPs: 
        separately by +/- and ocean/lakes/one focal lake

- proportion of variance contributed by each SNP


At some point:

- more quantitative genetics parameters, like epistatic variance, distribution of fitness effects
