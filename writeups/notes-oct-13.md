Notes after lab meeting on 10/12/17:

- Bill: liked the migration vs no migration comparison since it tells us
    how important the metapopluation structure is.
	"This ties into the decreasing migration Rates"



"This model would be interesting to see if the population could adapt even if migration had been cut-off for N generations"
- dominance: split each +/- class into under/overdominant classes
    with dominance coefficient 0.0 and 1.0),
    and compare usage of the two 
    (hypothesis: the underdominant freshwater alleles will be used more)
	"FOR THIS: create four mutation types. Use Eidos Script to determine wildtypes"
	


Final productst:

- higher-level plot with parameter on the x-axis and summary on the y-axis, e.g.:
	
	-"FOR EACH OF THESE, MAKE A SIMPLE GEOGRAPHIC CONTROL MODEL." 
	

    * x-axis:

        - migration rate "DONE, try 2.5/GEN is the Smallest, Go smaller with more data points, try .5:10 migrants/GEN"
        - number of individuals, by increasing number of lakes but keeping number per lake the same 
            (always, distance between lakes is the same)  
        - spatial structure, by keeping total number the same but increasing number of lakes 
        - size of new lake budded off "Try ~ 200. Non - continuous because they'll just be "  

    * y-axis:

        - SD of trait value in ocean and lake  
	- FST "GENETIC VARIENCE != PHENOTYPIC VARIENCE. (although I'm sure they're correlated.)"



"IN THE FUTURE"

- isolation by distance: Fst against distance in ocean, lake  "???? distance between lakes is longer ?????"

- what are frequencies of the functional SNPs used in the newly adapted population
    in the ocean?

    * make frequency trajectory plots of functional SNPs: 
        separately by +/- and ocean/lakes/one focal lake

- proportion of variance contributed by each SNP  


At some point:

- more quantitative genetics parameters, like epistatic variance, distribution of fitness effects
