Abstract: (What did I do in a NutShell?)

	-Rapid and Parallel adaptation to freshwater environments has been a common theme among the stickleback evolutionary history. 
	-To understand the evolutionary forces involved, We modeled the population dynamics using simulations. 
	-For this paper we will focus on the contibution of introgression and dominance.  ??
	-We want to explain the results of the model, make connection between results and real data collected from stickleback


Introduction: (What is the problem?)

	-Recap of middleton story
	-What evolutionary forces contributed to this adaptation?
	-Something about Potential vs Realized Architecture
		**Potential Architecture: The Parameters we define in our simulation 
		**Realized Architecture: The results that arrise as a product of evolutionary forces from parameters
	-Which Parameters are we going to look at 
		**migration rates, dominance of alleles, population size, #discrete populations)
	-explain the simulation in more evolutionary terms

Materials and Methods: (How did I solve the problem?)
	
	-SLiM, and evolutionary framework.
		**Ficher-Wright Model with geography and genomic architecture
	-Explain the simulaation we set up from a technical perspective 
		**All parameters involved 
	-Potential architecture

Results: (What did I find out?)

	-Realized Architecture ()
	-Introgression Allows for rapid adaptation.

Discussion: (What does it mean?)

	-How can this be more realistic
	-What might this imply about the stickleback evolution
