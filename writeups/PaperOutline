Title: ?????????

Abstract: (What did I do in a NutShell?)

	-Rapid and Parallel adaptation to freshwater environments has been a common theme among the stickleback evolutionary history. 
	-To understand the evolutionary forces involved, We modeled the population dynamics using simulations. 
	
	-(IMPORTANT) We want to explain the results of A MODEL, clearly. Show we understand what is happening with a controled (fixed) parameter space
		**This is a good way for people to believe our results are not so 'hand-wavy'.  
		**If we can fully understand and explain the 'control' model, then it gives integrity to the results we show when a a single parameter is changed. 
			
	-Make connection between results and real data collected from stickleback


Introduction: (What is the problem?) (context of all work, other studies that tie into)

	-Recap of middleton story, why do we care (not start)
	-there hasn't been something as specific as SLiM before. 
	-Why is this approach original and insightful? (Assumption)
		**Why do models help us draw conclutions
		**how can we rely on the results we find
	-What evolutionary forces contributed to parallel/rapid adaptation? (been settled)
		**We know the forces, what we want to know is the a patterns across the genome. (age of alleles, pattern) 
		**Why don't we know this
		**theory guids subsiquent work
		**have a model allows us to make predictions, what do 
		**history of introgression. 
	-Something about Potential vs Realized Architecture
		**processes instead of forces 
		**Potential Architecture: The Parameters we define in our simulation. 
		**Realized Architecture: The results that arrise as a product of evolutionary forces.
	-Which Parameters are we going to look at
		**be humble about the parameter we choose, explain the results clearly, and show the change as we turn a parameter knob  
		**migration rates, dominance of alleles, population size, #discrete populations)
	//-explain the simulation in more evolutionary terms
	//	**explain the connections we made between our model, and the stickleback history specific to middleton. (Our model is slightly more generic)

Materials and Methods: (How did I solve the problem?)
	
	-SLiM, and evolutionary framework. (Concise explanation)
		**Ficher-Wright Model with geography (sub-pops & migration), population structure (matechoice & fitness), and genomic architecture (the chromosome) 
	-Explain the simulaation we set up from a technical perspective (POTENTIAL ARCHITECTURE) 
		**All parameters put into SLiM
		**Explain what SLiM does with input. (aka how it makes choices)
	-WHAT and HOW Data was sampled from the simulation
		**Fst
		**Phenotype Distribution

Results: (What did I find out?)

	-Which evolutionary forces did we see in our results (REALIZED ARCHITECTURE)
		**genetic drift
		**benefit of introgression on 
	-Introgression Allows for rapid adaptation.
	-something about clustering, something about age. 
	-tweaking parameter and watching how these two things change. 
	-test against poisson. 

Discussion: (What does it mean?)

	-how are the results seen 
	-How can this be more realistic
	-What might this imply about the stickleback evolution 
	-What other parameter might be more closely examined 
		**Geographic/Population parameter
	-Connect to real.
