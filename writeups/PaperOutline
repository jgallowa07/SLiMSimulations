This is an outline of the paper I will write, mainly brainstrorming. The listed content for each section of the paper is not 
neccissarily how we want to order in it the actual paper


Title: ?????????

Abstract: (What did I do in a NutShell?)

	-Rapid and Parallel adaptation to freshwater environments has been a common theme among the stickleback evolutionary history. 
	-To understand the evolutionary forces involved, We modeled the population dynamics using simulations. 
	-For this paper we will focus on the contibution of introgression and dominance.  ??
	-We want to explain the results of the model, make connection between results and real data collected from stickleback


Introduction: (What is the problem?)

	-Recap of middleton story
	-What evolutionary forces contributed to this adaptation?
		**history of introgression. 
	-Something about Potential vs Realized Architecture
		**Potential Architecture: The Parameters we define in our simulation 
		**Realized Architecture: The results that arrise as a product of evolutionary forces from parameters
	-Which Parameters are we going to look at 
		**migration rates, dominance of alleles, population size, #discrete populations)
	-explain the simulation in more evolutionary terms
		**explain the connections we made between our model, and the stickleback history specific to middleton. (Our model is slightly more generic)

Materials and Methods: (How did I solve the problem?)
	
	-SLiM, and evolutionary framework. (Concise explanation)
		**Ficher-Wright Model with geography (sub-pops & migration), population structure (matechoice & fitness), and genomic architecture (the chromosome) 
	-Why is this approach original and insightful?
		**Why do models help us draw conclutions
		**how can we rely on the results we find
	-Explain the simulaation we set up from a technical perspective (POTENTIAL ARCHITECTURE) 
		**All parameters put into SLiM
		**Explain what SLiM does with input. (aka how it makes choices)
	-WHAT and HOW Data was sampled from the simulation
		**Fst
		**Average Phenotype

Results: (What did I find out?)

	-Which evolutionary forces did we see in our results (REALIZED ARCHITECTURE)
		**genetic drift
		**benefit of introgression on 
	-Introgression Allows for rapid adaptation.

Discussion: (What does it mean?)

	-how are the results seen 
	-How can this be more realistic
	-What might this imply about the stickleback evolution 
	-What other parameter might be more closely examined 
		**Geographic/Population parameter
